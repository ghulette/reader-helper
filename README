Reader Helper is a simple, tiny program that allows Apple's Safari browser to
add RSS subscriptions to Google Reader with one click. If you use Safari as
your main browser, and want to use Google Reader, you will want to use this
program.

Reader Helper is a much simpler version of reader-notifier
[http://code.google.com/p/readernotifier/]. No Growl, no downloading, not even
notifications. If you need that functionality, check out that project instead.


To build:

Just open the project in Xcode and build it.  Hope for the best.


To install and use:

To install Reader Helper simply download the latest bundle, double-click on
the disk image that appears, and drag the Reader Helper application file to
your Applications folder (or wherever). Then, in Safari go to Preferences and
select the RSS tab. Change "Default RSS Reader" to Reader Helper. Now whenever
you click RSS links in Safari (or the blue RSS button in the address bar),
Reader Helper will helpfully open Google Reader with the link. Google Reader
will ask you if you want to subscribe to the feed (you need to confirm before
the subscription is added).
